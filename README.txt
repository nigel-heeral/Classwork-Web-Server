README:

In order to run our server you need to provide JHTTP with two command line arguments: the root of your webpages folder and the port number. 

In line 54 of JHTTP, you need to change that directory to your own directory for the log file.

You also need to have all the files we uploaded, like the authorization and authentication files.  Those usernames are case sensitive when entering it in the HTML form.

To access the web pages type “localhost” in your web browser and you should see the login form.

In lines 194, 213, 236, 247 of JHTTP edit the path to the text file as needed.  Different IDE’s require paths to be formatted differently.
